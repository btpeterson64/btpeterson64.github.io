##Steps of DDoS Attack
1. A user of a site makes a request through the server
2. An attacker makes several rapid requests targeting the server
3. The firewall responds by closing the connection
4. The attacker employs the BotNet to target the server with attacks from multiple computers
5. The server is overloaded and may be slow or unable to respond to user requests
