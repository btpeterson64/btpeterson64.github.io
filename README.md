# About Me 
## Interests
- Video Games - I play video games, mostly on PC, sometimes on Xbox or Nintendo Switch
- Crafts - I make nerdy T-shirts, cosplay props, and Dungeon and Dragons miniatures
## Websites I Reccomend
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) - I find Reddit a valuable tool for learning anything about a new hobby.
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - This website has a tutorial for pretty much anything at this point. If I need to do random repairs on my house or car there is always a channel with about 200 followers that clearly shows me the solution.
